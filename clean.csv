- The MET sees about ~5.7M visitors per year
- MoMA about ~2.7M annual visitors 
- Statue of Liberty ~4.2M annual visitors 

And Dear New York passed them all in foot traffic, in less than two weeks!

Props to Brandon and the team for creating a moment that’ll live on in New York’s history.

humansofny,248329,3831,"A few years ago I received a DM from @zohrankmamdani. Only recently did I discover its existence. It was a very unusual DM—especially coming from a local assemblyman who would soon be running for higher office. He had very little name recognition at the time, and could have benefited from publicity. But unlike the thousands of messages I’ve received from people with something to promote, Zohran did not ask to be featured on Humans of New York. Instead he asked if he could introduce me to taxi drivers that were struggling beneath the burden of debt. Coming from a man with political ambitions, this self-denying request was so strange as to be almost singular. I don’t endorse politicians on Humans of New York. But I’ll endorse a good man. And it was a good man who cleared 30 minutes from his schedule yesterday to swing by Grand Central to visit Dear New York. Nearly fifty student artists were visiting that day with their families, and I thought a surprise visit from this widely-loved future mayor would be a special memory for all of them. Before Zohran’s arrival I was convinced I’d made a terrible mistake. The Vanderbilt Hall exhibit was filled to capacity with adult visitors. Dear New York is self-funded so there was very little staff and security for crowd control. In the crush of people I was almost certain this special day for the kids would devolve into thirty minutes of selfie requests. But everyone rose to the occasion. Hundreds of adults quickly cleared the room and stood outside the exhibit. Eleven very notable adult artists are also featured in the exhibition, but even they took a step back, so that these students could briefly have the stage to themselves. Each child stood by their work and Zohran was able to meet all of them, one at a time, and honor their contributions to the most-visited art show in New York City. Thanks to everyone who ceded the stage yesterday to make this moment possible. Thank you Zohran for literally sitting down on the floor so that these young artists could feel so tall. Thank you for continually centering other people in your life and work.

Dear New York is an immersive art installation by people, for people, and about people. Everyone who visits Grand Central Station becomes part of it. With the crowds seeming to grow 20% each passing day, the work continues to grow more and more meaningful. Come join us this weekend as Dear New York reaches full bloom. When you arrive you will find a Grand Central completely cleared of advertising. If you come by subway, you’ll enter through an immersive installation covering all three levels of Grand Central subway station, designed by @trabuccocampos and his team at @pentagramdesign. You’ll then emerge into an iconic main concourse which has been completely transformed with light projections into a showcase of NYC’s humanity. For the first time in history, the main concourse has also been transformed by two weeks of musical programming performed by the celebrated students and alumni of @juilliardschool . After taking in a performance, be sure to swing by Vanderbilt Hall to experience the most-visited, most-talked-about art exhibit in town, designed by the legendary @davidkorins , and featuring the work of eleven highly notable NYC photographers alongside the work of 600 school-aged student artists—every participant given the same museum-quality printing and framing by @pictonewyork .  At 8 PM on Sunday night, there will be a short closing ceremony featuring a performance by a 200-strong chorus from @ypcofnyc. Afterwards Dear New York will go dark forever.

humansofny,318108,6311,"We’ve lost a legend. Stephanie ‘Tanqueray’ Johnson passed away last night after suffering a severe stroke. She will be most remembered for holding the world in thrall with her no-holds-barred storytelling about life as a burlesque dancer in the 1970’s. Stephanie was a complicated person. Her public persona was irresistibly charismatic. Yet behind the scenes I’ve rarely met somebody who had such difficulty with close relationships. She was internationally adored, yet intensely lonely. She was desirous of companionship, yet quick to cut people out of her life over the smallest slights. Stephanie told me endless stories about how badly her mother treated her as a child, yet remained capable of exhibiting that same behavior toward others. People are complicated. And the longer you live, the more you realize the most inexcusable behavior often stems from the saddest traumas. There was always a little girl inside of Stephanie who never had a chance to feel safe. A little girl who learned at a young age that the best way to keep from getting hurt was to throw the first punch. But this little girl also had such a love of life. And despite her X-rated stories, and her sharp edges, was capable of such innocence. Stephanie slept with a teddy bear until the day she died. She’d melt in the presence of animals and babies. And until the very end, she laughed like a little girl. In the final weeks of her life all the hard edges melted away. All the defense mechanisms, the learned responses. She reverted back to the little girl she’d been before she’d gotten hurt. And that is the Stephanie that is smiling down on us right now. In her own words: ‘When I get to heaven I hope God shows me a movie of my life. But just the funny parts. Not the in-between parts, cause then we’d both start crying. Underneath all the laughs and the gags, it was always about one thing: survival. Tanqueray was a lot of fun. But Tanqueray was Stephanie. And Stephanie was a teenage runaway from Albany: doing what she needed to do, and being who she needed to be, to get what she needed to get.” I love ya, Steph. Thanks for taking me, and all of us, on the greatest ride of our lives.",[],https://www.instagram.com/p/DPuicxejcd3/,💐🙏🏾,"Photo by Humans of New York on October 12, 2025.

humansofny,46246,479,"“I’ve decided to go back to school today; I was just accepted into college, and I made the decision to enroll. I happened to be wearing my Coney Island shirt, so I decided to come out here and sit by the water. I used to come out here all the time. For many years I was in an extremely difficult marriage. I’d never say anything hurtful about my ex-wife, because there’s still a lot of love there— but there were times when I had to get away. And this is where I’d go. I ended up leaving the marriage right before the pandemic. I had to completely start over. I went from having my own apartment, and having all the things you’re supposed to have, to sleeping on a mattress on the floor. I never stopped teaching my voice and music lessons. I was still expanding, still growing. But I went through a lot of hardship. There was so much responsibility on me. My mother is 94; she has dementia. I was taking care of her too. For the longest time I’ve never had any room for something going on in my own life. So this is a very big thing for me—going back to school. I’m going to major in social work because I’d like to introduce a therapy element to my voice lessons. If I’m being honest, part of the reason is I need more clients. I’m not somebody who has a big retirement saved. I’m turning 65 soon and I’m no longer very competitive in an ageist music world. So money is part of it. But also, voice lessons are such a wonderful tool for self-actualization. I’ve noticed when people are learning to sing, they come up against so many things that are holding them back. They’ll meet with embarrassment. They’ll meet their inner critic. They’ll have moments where they think: that’s too loud, that’s too shrill. But they have to push past it. Because In order to fill the room, you first need a sense of being worthy enough to express yourself. You can’t say: I’m going to sing like this person. No, you’re going to sound like you. There are tools you can learn to sound like the best version of you, but you will sound like you. And it’s such a privilege to be present when people discover that for the first time: you can sing just like yourself, and it can be beautiful.”",[],https://www.instagram.com/p/DQHcr3MDRpE/,أنصح بالتأكد جيداً قبل أي تعامل… أنا خسرت مالي ولم أستفد شيئاً,"Photo by Humans of New York on October 22, 2025.

humansofny,22538,170,"Last night someone asked me what part of Dear New York I’m proudest of; this was hard to answer. But I can tell you what’s filled my heart the most. Many in the press are calling it ‘The Children’s Exhibit,’ because Dear New York’s Vanderbilt Hall features the work of six hundred NYC student artists. Each student was asked to photograph and write about someone who has made a difference in their lives. Some of these artists are as young as four, and their photography might not be the most technically polished, but there is a striking intimacy that can only come from photographing someone you love. The written profiles which accompany the photographs are extremely touching, and collectively represent the millions of invisible, unsung heroes that form the bedrock of NYC’s community. It’s not the mayors and the movie stars that form the heart of this city. It’s the mothers, the fathers, the teachers, the social workers, and the millions of other people who show up every day in the lives of others. One reason the ‘Children’s Exhibit’ lands so deeply is that its amplified by a sister exhibition featuring eleven highly notable NYC photographers. Among them are living legends such as @jamelshabazz , a trailblazer in street portraiture. As well as Gugenheim Fellow @sarabennettbrooklyn , a former public defender who profiles formerly-incarcerated women. The two exhibits are blended seamlessly in an innovative, immersive design by @davidkorins . The most beautiful part of these blended exhibits is that all 611 artists— young and old, beginning and established— have been given the same museum-quality framing and presentation. The result is an egalitarian, non-hierarchical ode to the diversity, humanity, and community of this city.  The exhibit has been overflowing all week, from open to close, and I’m not sure I’ve ever seen an art installation elicit so much emotion. Dear New York closes on Sunday. For everyone who attends the final Sunday, you will be able to meet all eleven featured professional artists, who will be there to greet visitors between 2 pm and 5 pm.",[],https://www.instagram.com/p/DP6-xnlkSRe/,😍😍😍❤️,"Photo by Humans of New York on October 17, 2025.

humansofny,15054,257,"How does a two-week art installation about community grow into something like this? I think it’s because people are tired of ‘connecting’ through screens. Nobody wants to live in a metaverse, whatever the hell that is. We don’t want to become passive consumers of songs that ‘seem’ human, art that ‘seems’ human, friends that ‘seem’ human. None of this stuff is what we need. We need to create. We need to connect. We need to serve other people if we’re going to have any sort of place or belonging in this world. If humanity is going to thrive— and if art is going to thrive – there is only one place for it to go: the real world. Dear New York was founded upon the increasingly rare belief that humanity is pretty freaking amazing. This isn’t a perfect world. Every day the media brings us new examples of glaring injustice and senseless violence. We still have much work to do. But while we do the work, let us not forget how much love there is in this world. In New York City alone, in a single day, there are millions of stories of people taking care of each other. These stories don’t make the evening news, but they’re no less real. And when you sum it all up—the good and the bad – humanity is still worth fighting for. It’s still something to celebrate.

humansofny,39139,459,"I’d like to conclude with one final story that I think captures the spirit of Dear New York. During the final hour before Sunday’s closing ceremony there was no performer scheduled on the Steinway Concert Grand, so I loudly invited everyone in the crowd to take a turn. About six or seven random New Yorkers stepped forward, bravely volunteering for this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to play the world’s finest piano for a huge crowd of people in Grand Central Station. It was such a joyous and communal experience. Each person played one song. Everyone was at-least-a-little nervous, but everyone nailed it under the brightest possible spotlight. Eventually one of the producers whispered that it was time to wrap up, but before I could tell everyone ‘Goodnight,’ I noticed the tiniest little hand being raised. It belonged to a six-year-old girl wearing a denim jacket, sparkly cowboy boots, and a small plastic princess crown. I knelt down and asked her name; she told me ‘Charlotte.’ I asked Charlotte if she wanted a chance to play, and she nodded with conviction. Her mother— half-proud, half-terrified—quickly told me that Charlotte had a keyboard at home, but had never played piano before. This small distinction did not bother Charlotte one bit. With the confidence of Liberace, she marched up to the Steinway, took a seat, and played piano for the very first time, in front of hundreds of people. I’m not sure anyone beyond the first row could hear it. But I am sure that everyone could feel it. Immediately following her performance, two hundred young singers from The Young People’s Chorus of New York City brought Dear New York to a close with an epic performance. (Video clip in carousel.)

humansofny,674224,1232,"Eleven years ago I received a DM from some guy named Lin-Manuel Miranda. I’d never heard of him. He had about 30,000 Twitter followers at the time. He’d created a critically acclaimed show called ‘In The Heights,’ but I wasn’t fluent enough with Broadway for that to ring a bell. In his DM he told me to ‘holler’ at him if I ever came up to Washington Heights. A few weeks later, that’s exactly what I did. Why? Because I needed a Spanish interpreter, and I wanted to know if he’d consider accompanying me while I collected stories. Lin informed me that this would not be possible, because he’d just come home from the hospital with his newborn son. ‘Oh, really?’ I asked. And that’s how I randomly took the first portrait of the brand-new Miranda family. Lin mentioned at the time that he was working on ‘some play about Alexander Hamilton.’ Four months later Hamilton would have its off-Broadway premiere at the Public Theater. And well, the rest is history. I’ve always treasured this small intersection I had with Lin before the rocket ship took off. Not because I got to watch him change. But because I got to watch how little he changed. He’s remained the same good man I met that day: enamored with his newborn son, enamored with his wife, enamored with life. He’s gone on to compose music for so many celebrated films, modeling that zest for life to millions of children around the world— including my own. (I’m a Moana man myself, with all due respect to the Family Madrigal.) But what I’ve most admired about Lin is how much he supports other people. I’m not sure I’ve ever seen someone use their platform to so consistently highlight and uplift fellow artists. In that vein, he immediately agreed when I asked if he’d drop by Dear New York to play the Steinway Concert Grand. He spent days trying to lower my expectations. ‘I’m not a pianist,’ he said. ‘All I can do is noodle on the keys.’ And that’s exactly what he did this morning. He ‘noodled’ his way into the memories and lives of hundreds of very surprised people in Grand Central Station. Thank you @lin_manuel , for always reaching behind you to lift others up.

At Dear New York Grand Central, six-year-old Whitney Guo Szakacs delivered what music critics could only breathlessly describe as ‘undoubtedly the greatest performance ever staged in a public transit hub by a six-year-old staying up past her bedtime.’ Following Whitney’s recent world debut for a crowd of twenty residents at the New Jewish Nursing Home, it seemed that her star could not climb any higher. Until she sat down at that Steinway Concert Grand in the center of the world and stunned onlookers with the one song she knows. A mighty song. A song played with such grace and beauty that it might as well have been a million songs. Whitney’s preparations for this big moment could only be described as Olympian. She took an hour-and-a-half nap, ate some Pad Thai, and said ‘I believe in myself’ nearly thirty times.

As many of you know I am staging a public art installation in Grand Central from October 6th through October 19th, called Dear New York. It is the largest event in the 112-year history of Grand Central, and the entire building has been transformed into a piece of art celebrating the people of this city. 100 percent of advertising has been removed from the building and replaced with portraits and stories from Humans of New York. It was important to me, both spiritually and artistically, to share this iconic stage and canvas with other artists. I knew that Dear New York would never correctly represent New York unless its creators were as diverse as the work itself. In the end over 1000 artists contributed to Dear New York, making it one of the largest pieces of public art in history. Importantly, nobody was asked to work for free: Dear New York involved over $500,000 in direct payments to artists. Which finally brings us to the opportunity: as part of Dear New York, Steinway has donated a Model D Concert Grand, which has been placed in the center of Grand Central's main concourse. This is the most legendary piano in the world, in one of the world's most iconic public spaces. It is the rarest of events and God bless the secretly-artistic-souls at the MTA for allowing this civic gift. @juilliardschool has stepped up to provide musical programming for the entire two weeks of the installation. That is-- until 10 pm each night -- when this most legendary of pianos, in this most legendary of rooms, goes silent. In the spirit of Dear New York, I want to open this stage to other New York pianists. If you are interested in playing for one late-night hour, write to me at dearnysubmissions@gmail.com. Obviously this piano must be treated with great dignity and respect. Please include a link to a video of you playing. (Nothing that needs to be downloaded, please.)

This city has provided me with the most blessed life any one person can ask for. And when I say ‘this city,’ I mean one thing: it’s people. For me, New York has always been the people. Many of you know that tomorrow my next book Dear New York will be released. It is my love letter to the city, and I’ve never been prouder of a work I’ve created—until now.

All advertising has been removed from the building and replaced with portraits and stories from Humans of New York. But it doesn’t stop there. Grand Central was far too large a canvas for one person, so more than 1000 artists have joined me to contribute to this vision.

Some of these kids have been with me four years. It’s been a great pleasure to watching them grow: going from not knowing how to catch, to knowing how to catch, to getting baseball ready. But baseball is just the vessel to get them in. As you can see, we don’t just come play baseball and leave. We barbecue every two weeks. We have a lot of events with the kids: trunk-or-treat, Christmas giveaways, birthday parties. It’s not just come play ball, I’ll see you next week. It’s everything. It’s a family. Let’s grow this into where you can have friends for the rest of your life. There’s a lot of troubled kids getting into fights and doing things like that.

My father had a very bad gambling addiction. People were knocking on our doors late at night, looking for money. So my mom took us kids out of the situation and started working two jobs. She’d take both a train and a bus to get into the city. Then she’d come back to the Bronx, make us dinner, and head straight to her job as a cashier. When I was sixteen years old, she got a $500 bonus for Christmas. She saw that I was becoming a man, so she bought me my first set of nice clothes. Spent the entire $500 on me. I did what I could to lessen her stress. I walked a very straight line: never drank, never did drugs. All that mattered to me was making sure she retired at a young age. I became a cop, I started paying all her bills. It was important to me that she never tax her body again. But I was a lousy cop. I was so soft that I couldn’t even write tickets. I ended up packing my bags and moving out to Vegas, hoping to get a restaurant job in one of the casinos. But nobody would hire me. I was getting desperate, down to my last $500. And that’s when my grandfather died. This man was like a father figure to me. I was heartbroken. I was out of money. And I couldn’t even tell my mother the truth, because I knew she’d start working again. It was a Sunday, and I happened to drive past a Catholic church that was being built. They were financing construction by selling plaques for $500. And look— I don’t force religion on anybody. Even my kids. But I do tell them: ‘Please, believe in something. Because your mother and I won’t be able to answer all your questions. Life will put you in situations that require something deeper.’ And all those years ago, on that Sunday in Vegas, I just believed with all my heart that Christ was on my side. So I took my last $500 and bought a plaque in honor of my grandfather. The next day I opened the paper and saw a job opening at a bistro. I bullshitted my way into the position, and twelve months later I was running four locations.

humansofny,48306,338,"“To raise a son, not from her own body, for thirty years—nobody accepts this easily. But my biological mother was under a lot of stress; I was one of triplets. So my aunt volunteered to raise me as her own. She never got married; it was always just the two of us; that’s why I call her Mom. She was like an angel— she did everything for me, took care of every need. She used to pray for me all the time: ‘Allah yarda ʿalayk.’ This is difficult to translate, but it means: ‘May God be satisfied with you.’ All the time she prayed this. And God was listening. The rest of the family thought she spoiled me too much, and I would never amount to anything. For a while it seemed like they might be right. In university I tried to major in English commerce but I got stuck on it, and failed out of school. It made my Mom look bad. My other siblings were very committed, very religious— so it seemed like she had bad luck raising a kid. But she never gave up on me. She kept praying: ‘Allah yarda ʿalayk.’ When I changed my field to nursing, she tried to discourage me. She’d been a nurse her whole life, so she knew how difficult it was. But I told her: I want to be a nurse too, so I’ll always have something to remind me of you. I did my best and got very good grades. When I got a job at the hospital, I treated many of our relatives. They’d return home and tell my mom: ‘Wow. Yehya took care of us. He got us everything we needed.’ This is what she had always prayed for- for people to say good things about me. It’s all she ever wanted, and she got to see it. With my salary I helped her buy a new house. It’s gone now, it got bombed. But we were able to live there for two years together. She got to meet my daughter Zainab, who I named after her. She got to see all these things. She passed away right before the war, thank God. She would not have been able to handle it. And she died exactly how she wanted to die. It was sudden. Maybe a stroke, or an embolism that stuck in her heart. And I was there; I got to hold her in my arms as she passed away. If you’d have asked how she wanted to die, she would have told you: exactly this way. It’s what she always prayed for.

humansofny,17015,160,"When I started Humans of New York I had only been photographing for three months. I had no idea what I was doing. But I was bailed out by the explosion of social media, sheer determination, and the power of a good idea. I was a twenty-six-year-old kid with this crazy dream to tell the story of New York City, one person at a time. And it worked. The first Humans of New York book sold almost a million copies— but even then, I was only beginning to figure out the craft. In the twelve years since I have learned so much: about photography, about interviewing, about writing, about people. And I was moved by the urge to do it again. I wanted to try my best to capture this city; only this time, I knew exactly what I was doing. For nearly two years I took a step back from social media. I focused on one thing: this book. I collected hundreds of stories from all over this city, with the hope that Dear New York would become the most enduring piece of this crazy idea I had, all those years ago. In all the madness and joy of what’s happening at Grand Central this week, I want to pause for a moment to honor and introduce the book that inspired it all. Dear New York is based on a simple idea: This city is humanity itself. Every type of person is here: every ethnicity, every culture, every belief, every viewpoint. And all of us are crammed onto the same narrow sidewalks, packed into the same subway cars. We sometimes annoy the hell out of each other, but we also show up for each other. We take care of each other. In a world that can seem to be teetering on the edge, New York remains something to celebrate. Humanity remains something to celebrate. Dear New York is published today. It was made with all my heart, and I very much hope that you love it.",[],https://www.instagram.com/p/DPhwirbjd6U/,❤️❤️,"Photo by Humans of New York on October 07, 2025.

humansofny,63665,175,"I have a confession to make. I have not been 100 percent truthful. All week, in interviews and social media posts, I have been repeating the false claim that Dear New York has transformed ‘all of Grand Central’ into a piece of art celebrating the people and community of this city. I got a little caught up in the hype. This statement was not exactly true, and I apologize. I would now like to correct the record. Dear New York has entirely transformed the historic main concourse. It has transformed every level of the massive Grand Central subway system with an immersive installation designed by @trabuccocampos and his team at @pentagramdesign. It has transformed 150 digital screens, and all available signage into a celebration of the people of this city. It has filled the air with musical programming from @juilliardschool. It has transformed Grand Central’s stunning Vanderbilt Hall into a ‘crowd favorite’ exhibit  designed by @davidkorins which blends the work of 600 student artists with established artists, including the living legend @jamelshabazz. But here is where I got a little carried away. If you were one of the tens of thousands of people who became part of Dear New York yesterday, you might have noticed that the Vanderbilt Hall exhibit was closed. Alas, the truth cannot stay buried long: Dear New York was unable to secure 100 percent of Grand Central for the entirety of these two weeks. Exactly one thing was already on the calendar. Last night, Saturday October 11th, the first wedding Grand Central has seen in fifteen years took place in Vanderbilt Hall. But oh, what a beautiful inconvenience. Because how could you possibly celebrate the diversity and humanity of this city…. without a wedding. Congratulations to David and Meredith Garrett.

There were five of us girls. The watchman saw us and began to call us back, and all of them ran back, except for me. I kept running. The only thing is—I literally had nowhere to go. My uncles worked in the middle of the city. If I went there, they would see me. Nothing ever happens in Gaza City without everyone finding out and everyone talking about it. So I just went home. That’s the thing about this place; it’s the only place I feel like I belong, but it was always so suffocating. There wasn’t even space for a teenager to be rebellious. I think the craziest thing we did was paint on walls. Like all teenagers we were convinced that everything was so dark, and the world was ending. So we’d graffiti Pink Floyd and Cold Play lyrics onto walls: ‘Lights will guide you home.’ Meanwhile home is literally two blocks away, two streets away. The entire neighborhood is rubble now. Honestly I don’t even like to talk about the past because it feels like the world keeps begging us to prove that we’re human beings. And if we could only do that, if we could prove that we once lived in nice houses, and listened to Cold Play, then we could prove that we deserve to live and eat and exist and survive. I hate it. I hate pity so much, because it belittles the person you’re pitying. Please don’t feel sorry for me. Don’t feel sorry for us. We don’t need you, I promise. We don’t need anyone. We have farmers with farmlands, but they cannot harvest their own farmlands without being shot. We have fishermen who can collect fish from the sea, but they’re banned from using the sea. We have these beautiful, beautiful cuisines. We can feed ourselves. Just let us, we’ve reached that point. Just let us. Don’t feel sorry for us. Feel sorry for yourselves, that you’re living in a country that is arming Israel, that is sending weapons overseas to kill children. Your bombs are killing children. If that bothers you, then don’t feel sorry for us. Feel sorry for yourself.

It’s also perfect for me because it means ‘peace, love, and harmony.’ And everyone who meets me says that I’m positive energy shining everywhere. I’m a team leader for twenty-three pharmacists. ‘The pharma army,’ we call it. Ask anyone: we are the happiest team in the hospital. After we start our morning meeting, I’ll put on a bit of music for everyone. If they want to dance, they can dance. If they want to sing, they can sing. We are working 24 hours, seven days a week without stopping. They are under so much stress, all the time. There are always mass casualty incidents. And everyone in Gaza is living their own nightmare: with the bombings, the displacements, the hunger. So I’m just trying to make it easier for them. When I help others, it feels like I’m doing something right, that I’m still useful in this life. In Islam, if you speak a good word to someone else, it is also a good thing for you. So if someone smiles, and says: ‘Good job, you did it, you survived another day.’ This is a big deal for us. So I try to keep a smile from ear to ear. But on the inside, no. I am not happy at all. I haven’t slept for more than three hours since the war began. We are all screwed up in this world. Even if you are still alive in this moment, maybe in five minutes you will die. The smallest spark of light can be destroyed in the blink of an eye. How can anyone be happy when they are surrounded by so much death? But there is something that my mother said to me, right before she died. It’s the only memory that I have of her. She told me: ‘Weam, please keep that smile on your face. Because everyone loves your smile.’ So that’s what I’m trying to do. I’m trying.

humansofny,68571,1325,"“Before the war I never thought of getting married— maybe after 30 or something. But when the war started my mind changed. Every night I am awakened by airstrikes. I live near the sea, and the helicopters are coming from the sea. Whenever I hear them, I am thinking: ‘What if this one is for me?” And if these shots are for me—how is it going to feel?’ A few months ago my uncles family—they died, to the very last, including the baby. They were sheltering in a school that got bombed. They say when something like that happens, you don’t feel anything. So if it happens to me, this is what I hope. But sometimes you get trapped beneath the rubble. And it takes a long time to die. It’s very scary to think about. For the first time in my life I’ve started to feel like I need someone— someone to tell me that everything’s going to be okay. Four months ago I became engaged. Her name is Lama. She’s the sister of my best friend Kareem, who was killed in a bombing last year. I was driving to her house today. I’d put on jeans, and was smelling very good, and I started thinking: ‘Maybe I shouldn’t be so happy. Because things are so bad for everyone.’ But if I’m being honest, we are very happy. It is maybe even better than being in love in a normal situation. Sometimes when I wake up from the airstrikes: I’ll send her a very sweet message: ‘I hope you are very good,’ and so on. This is something that is nothing during normal times. But it’s a bit different when you are checking if someone is alive. All these things, which used to seem like nothing, are everything to us now. I visit her two or three times a week. Every time I go to her house, we have like five minutes or so.  If she’s upset about Kareem, upset about the situation, afraid of the missiles, I’ll calm her down. I’ll give her a hug. It’s a very great feeling, honestly. I don’t know how to describe it. It’s not going to stop bullets, or bombs, but it makes you feel safe. By that I mean, at least I’m with her and she’s with me. If something happens to me, it is going to happen to her. So we going to be in the same situation. We will live together, or we will die together.

I decided to focus on my house, my family, my children. When the war started I was working as a data encoder; I spent all day on the laptop. But Doctors Without Borders said to me: ‘Kholoud, there is no one left to ask. We need you to help organize our operations in the North.’ And I’ve done it. I organized a network of people on the ground. Everyone in the organization knows me now, respects me. And I’ve done all of this while raising four children, and another four children who lost their parents. In December we spent fifteen days on the street because there were too many bombs. Nobody could sleep safely inside. I ate nothing during this time, zero. I just drank some water every two days. We were sheltering in a small corridor inside a school yard. My husband left us to look for food, and that’s when the bomb fell. When it falls close to you, you don’t hear anything. You just see the body parts flying through the air: the hand of someone, the leg of someone, the head of someone. My son comes to me and his face is blood. My daughter comes to me and she is clutching her chest. My other two children are holding their legs; I can’t tell how they are injured. There was no hospital left in Gaza City, so I brought them back to our house. Our neighbor is a doctor, so I asked him to come over. We discovered that one of my children had shrapnel in the head. The other three in the leg. There was no anesthesia, no stitches. We put something in the children’s mouth, and I held them down while he removed the shrapnel with the kitchen knife. You cannot imagine how the children were screaming. But we removed the shrapnel. And when we finished, I took the knife, and removed the shrapnel from my own leg. ‘Too kind, too sensitive.’ I heard this my entire life. But I can tell you: another person lives inside you.

Some of them are mutilated: they’ve lost a leg, or an arm. You see children crying because they cannot walk again. Yes, there is a lot of children like this now. But even the ones who aren’t injured are changing. Before the war it was not normal to find a child who wasn’t in school. There were organizations that would find the parents and force them to enroll. But now Gaza’s children haven’t been to school in two years. They’re changing. They’re beginning to think: ‘I will never go to school. I will just work to bring my family food or water.’ Even my own daughter; she’s twelve years old. She was a leader in school and she dreamed to be a doctor. She has a cousin in Canada, the same age. They have video calls, and my daughter can see the difference.

I wanted to throw them all out of Gaza so that they could see the world, and then bring them back, with different views, and different thoughts. But there’s also a brilliance to the people here.

In political science class we used to learn about things like ethics, and human rights, and international law. But life in Gaza will teach you that these things are just propaganda. Propaganda that fooled us into believing that if only people knew what was going on, they’d stop it. It was this naive notion that led us, at least me and all of my friends, to film and document and speak and share on our stupid Instagrams. But I’ve lost the will. It’s too exhausting.

humansofny,405219,10881,"“When I entered Gaza the Israeli military had a rule: I was only allowed to bring in seven pounds of food. As I was weighing out protein bars, trying to get under the limit, I said to my husband: ‘How sinister is this?’ I’m a humanitarian aid worker. Why would there even be a limit on food? I’ve worked in many places with extreme hunger, but what’s so jarring in this context is how cruel it is, how deliberate. I was in Gaza for two months; there’s no way to describe the horror of what’s happening. And I say this as a pediatric ICU doctor who sees children die as part of my work. Among our own staff we have doctors and nurses who are trying to treat patients while hungry, exhausted. They’re living in tents. Some of them have lost fifteen, twenty members of their families. In the hospital there are kids maimed by airstrikes: missing arms, missing legs, third degree burns. Often there’s not enough pain medication. But the children are not screaming about the pain, they’re screaming: ‘I’m hungry! I’m hungry!” I hate to only focus on the kids, because nobody should be starving. But the kids, it just haunts you in a different way. When my two months were finished, I didn’t want to leave. It’s a feeling I haven’t experienced in nearly twenty years of humanitarian assignments. But I felt ashamed. Ashamed to leave my Palestinian colleagues, who were some of the most beautiful and compassionate people that I’ve ever met. I was ashamed as an American, as a human being, that we’ve been unable to stop something that is so clearly a genocide. I remember when our bus pulled out of the buffer zone. Out the window on one side I could see Rafah, which was nothing but rubble. On the other side was lush, green Israel. When we exited the gate, the first thing I saw was a group of Israeli soldiers, sitting at a table, eating lunch. I’ve never felt so nauseous seeing a table full of food.”",[],https://www.instagram.com/p/DNOV-qQOdbN/,💔🇯🇴,"Photo by Humans of New York on August 11, 2025.

So Rita is a product of love between me and my wife. I haven’t seen either of them in a year and a half. When the border opened last year, I sent them both out of the country. I hold a Master’s degree in Burns, Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery—and these skills are deeply needed in Gaza. So I chose to stay behind. Now the border is closed, and I couldn’t leave if I wanted to. I do my best to talk to Rita on WhatsApp every day. I’ll ask about kindergarten, and her swimming lessons. I’ll look at her latest drawings, and try to encourage her. But that’s it; I’m a WhatsApp father only. A few days ago she was ignoring me a bit, so I asked: ‘Why don’t you talk to me?’ She told me: ‘I feel like I forgot you a little bit.’ My wife jumped in, and said: ‘No, no, she’s kidding.’ But I said: ‘She doesn’t need to be kidding. She’s saying the truth.’ I’ve been gone most of her life. First with my studies in England, and now with this separation. I do feel guilty, yes. But if I had left, I’d feel even more guilty. There’d be a crack in my heart. It would come to me in my nightmares, every time I saw the suffering of my people. The first stage of this genocide was to destroy the health infrastructure, so there’d be no refuge for the dying. I happen to be part of an organization, Doctors Without Borders, with big abilities and big principles. I knew that if we worked together, and made the right decisions, and did the right things—we’d be able to provide comfort to countless people. And that’s what we’ve done. I’ve co-managed a team that built a field hospital with 120 beds, and three surgical theaters running 24 hours. This is something I’ll be proud of for years and years. And I hope one day Rita will understand. I’ll ask her to read books and watch documentaries about the genocide. I’ll ask her to understand that I couldn’t close my eyes to the suffering of our people. We must resist. And how do we resist? By existing. And how do we exist? By having a value.

We decided that if we ever had another daughter, her name would be Abigail. I’ve always loved that name. But we weren’t in a rush to get pregnant again. I was young. And we never predicted that we’d have all these struggles. It wasn’t until the miscarriage that we decided to try fertility treatments. By then Ashley was already twelve. It was one of the most difficult periods of my life: the cycles, the shots. You keep going through the motions, hoping something good will happen. It steals all the joy from your current life. Eventually the doctors told us there was a zero percent chance without IVF, so we decided to give up and focus on our little family of three. Ashley promised me if she ever had a daughter, she’d name her Abigail. There was a bit of a grieving process; I’d spent so long envisioning the baby. But we focused on making Ashley’s childhood as special as possible. I tried to create little traditions. We always watched Fiddler on the Roof the night before Yom Kippur. And on the first day of school, I’d always cook chicken soup. Even after Ashley went to college, I would send her off to school with chicken soup. During her senior year I began to not feel well. At first I thought COVID, because it was during the pandemic. Then I thought early menopause, because I was forty-one already. But one sleepless night I found a box of pregnancy tests that had expired ten years earlier. They still worked. I used all ten of them, and each time there was the bright pink line. There was no joy at first. I was so afraid of having another miscarriage. It was a very difficult pregnancy, so I made a deal with God. I don’t know why, but I promised him that if I could carry to term, I wouldn’t color my hair until the birth. By the time she came my hair was very, very gray. How do I even describe it? So much joy. It’s a second season, a second wind. A few years ago we were preparing for early retirement.

I don’t want to say the relationship fell apart because of our daughter. It was mostly us. We were going through a stressful time: I’d just lost my mother, she’d just lost her grandmother. We were going through an eviction and had to move into a shelter. We just handled our stress in different ways. She dealt with it by wanting to be young and dumb and free. We were arguing about everything, and I’m not good at arguing. I don’t like confrontation. I get agitated, antsy. Every time there was an argument, I’d get so angry that I’d have to leave the facility to get some air. I’ve been that way since childhood. My mom and my dad were heavy addicts; they lost custody of me when I was four. I grew up in programs. I didn’t have nobody to show me affection. And it made me angry, I was an angry kid. I saw that other people had love, and understood it, and to be honest, I wasn’t okay with it. There are times where I still feel like that, sometimes even now as a father. But every time I look at her it goes away. It went away the moment she was born. When you held your first kid, did you see a glow around them? Did you ever see a glow? Because I saw a glow. And I felt it. It was like, holy shit.  I wanted to cry the first time I felt it, because I wasn’t sure what it was. I was confused. But as it gradually grew on me, I was like: OK, so this is what love is. And it felt beautiful. It made me want to be better. I don’t want my daughter seeing the side of me from when I was young and didn’t know how to cope with my anger. Right now I have her every day after school. There’s a counselor at her school: Mr. Gonzalez. I go to see him once, sometimes twice a week. He’s been very helpful. He’s teaching me how to cope with life, how to handle arguments with my baby’s mother. Now if she texts me twenty paragraphs about things that happened six years ago, I don’t fight back.

I don’t want to say much more to that effect, but when it happened, I lost faith in humanity. I didn’t trust anybody. Life became all about me, so I just survived. A lot of my family members still won’t talk to me because they remember a Johnny that wasn’t trustworthy. I became a wanderer, there’s no better way to say it. And one day ten years ago I wandered into this park looking for a place to sit down. I saw an old man playing chess, in exchange for donations. He was waiting for an oncomer so I came on. He beat me senseless. But it was my first taste of communication with a stranger sitting across from me. And I thought to myself: ‘I can do that too.’ I bought myself a chess board. In the beginning I got the shit kicked out of me by strangers from all over the world. But I grew game after game, learning the fundamentals, then learning all the other stuff. And now I teach them to anybody who wants to play. I get donations, but it’s not the money that’s the fruit of my take. It’s when people sit down. I call it fruit, is that weird? Because when you share an activity with someone for fifteen minutes, a half hour—it nourishes your soul. Me looking at you, us laughing, doing bad moves, good moves— it’s all so nourishing. Because of chess I got to witness the difference between good and evil. So many have sat across from me that are so good— honest people with great, great hearts. I knew that very first day that this seat would make my life more significant. I knew as long as I kept sitting here, people would keep coming. And there is so much fruit that you get from people.

We have to be strong for Mom.’’ But when we walked into the room, before we could even say a word, Mom pointed at the wrap on her head and said: ‘Chiquita Banana Lady.’ And everyone started laughing, and snot crying.

It was a horrible form of brain cancer. Those last fifteen months we watched it take everything from her. She was paralyzed on one side of her body. She couldn’t walk. The tumor was pressing against the speech center of her brain, so she slowly lost her ability to speak. Words started disappearing. It was very frustrating for her. She’d know what she wanted to say, and she’d reach, and reach, and reach— but it wasn’t there. I couldn’t bear to see her get frustrated. At the time I was a freshman in college. She’d ask me about school, and I’d rush to finish her sentences as soon as she opened her mouth.

Toward the end she was down to just a few words, but two of those words were: ‘unconditional love.” They were unlikely words to hold onto. They weren’t easy to say, so many syllables. But ‘unconditional love’ became her answer to everything. It was her replacement for all the sentences and paragraphs she could not say. I remember our last conversation. I think she was trying to tell me to take care of my sister, but she couldn’t quite get the words out. She got so frustrated that she started to cry. I couldn’t bear to see it, so I just started talking.

They see you struggling, and say: ‘Why don’t you just stop doing it?’ But if they knew how important it was to me, they would never ask that. I had a little success in my late twenties. I was part of a band that signed to a record label, but we never had any hit music. It was mainly local stuff. Most of my thirties was working two jobs, struggling to pay bills, playing a late-night slot on a Tuesday night in a room with no people there, or maybe just a couple of my friends. It’s not that I felt disrespected, just not noticed. I guess obscure would be a good word. You’re lugging your guitar around everywhere. Nothing’s happening. It feels like you’re trying to hammer a nail with a banana. Those are the years where you say: ‘Man, is this really what I want to be doing? Can I live like this and be happy?’ But every time I tried to put my guitar down, I’d find myself writing a poem, or writing a lyric, or trying to write a riff. Turns out that I did need to be creative to be happy, more than I needed to be successful. It’s been a long journey. It’s like any other small business; you’ve got to build it one brick at a time. Even though my thirties were some tough years, it was during those years that my songwriting began to improve incredibly.

Everyone in it— my mother, my father, my four sisters, my brother, my baby niece— became a memory in the same instant. During the war, the home had become our lifeline. Comfort wasn’t always in words. It was in a shared cup of tea in the dark. It was my mother holding our hands, her presence a silent promise that we were not alone. It was my sisters distracting the children with stories. We would huddle together, our physical closeness a shield against the terrifying sounds outside. It’s probably a mercy that the house is now gone, because I don’t think my heart could bear to see the physical emptiness of the rooms where so much life once existed. It’s the ‘unimportant’ moments, the background noise of a living family, that I miss the most. I miss the sound of my father’s key in the door at the end of the day. I miss my mother’s hand on my forehead, checking for a fever that wasn’t there, just out of habit. I miss arguing with Nour about politics and then laughing about it two minutes later. I miss Mona’s quiet smile from across the room, a look that says: ‘I understand. I miss Ayat bursting into my room to show me a funny video. I miss the boys debating which one of them was the better gamer. Where all that beautiful noise used to be—there is nothing but profound silence. If I had one more moment with each of them, I would simply say: ‘Thank you.’ To my father: ‘Thank you for believing in me more than I ever believed in myself.’ To my mother: ‘Thank you for every silent sacrifice I was too young or too busy to notice.’ To my sisters and brothers: ‘Thank you for being the irreplaceable pieces of my childhood and my heart.’ And if I could sit all of them together one more time, the whole family, I would say to them: ‘I see you.

humansofny,99140,1885,"“The shift started like any other. I was making my rounds when around 2 pm I heard a bombing; it sounded very close. My family lives relatively near the hospital. Usually, when a bombing is that close, I would call them immediately. But on that day I didn’t call. I don’t know why. Maybe I’d grown desensitized. But after an hour I began to notice that the nurses were acting shifty around me. I was summoned to a case in the emergency room, and as we were walking down the hallway, one of the nurses asked if I’d heard from my family. That’s when I knew. I started running to the ER. The first person I found was my father. He’d been in the explosion area; he was stunned. My sister was next to him, she was also in shock. I asked about my mother and the nurse told me that she was in the ICU. It wasn’t true. But that’s what he told me, so he could get me alone. The ICU is three floors up from the ER, so I immediately began running up the stairs. The nurse ran after me. We passed the first floor, the second floor, and then he stopped me forcefully. He told me: ‘I’m sorry. I didn’t know how to tell you. But your mother is deceased.’ I fell to the floor. And I can’t remember everything here, I was in shock. But they brought me to the forensics room and led me to a giant, white bag. I unzipped it. And I saw her face. She looked as good as alive. She had bled out through her legs, so her face was untouched. And I wanted so bad to kiss her in that moment. So I kissed her. And I began to hug her. But they pulled me away and they covered her again. I’m sorry. I’m sorry for the tears. But this is the first time I’ve talked to anyone about this. I have to be strong for my family. Especially because my father is a paraplegic now; it’s a lot of responsibility. I need to be the emotional sponge for everyone else. That’s my focus now: caring for my father, my siblings, my patients. I want to help other people, and be a good Muslim. It’s not that deep. I just have to believe that she’s in a better place. And if I fulfill my responsibilities, then we will meet again. It’s what I have to believe. It’s all the relief I can get.” (2/2)",[],https://www.instagram.com/p/DNRQju_uxpH/,"@summer_life32 Palestinian kids are taught to hate and how to use guns in school.

One day I’ll explain the rest to her. Thankfully it was early, three months. It still hurts. But you know, God has a plan. He knew what I could handle and what I couldn’t. I try not to think about it much. But there’s certain things that remind me: her birthday, certain holidays, when I see butterflies. I’ve always thought of them as my butterflies, because they were so fragile. And I always imagine them fluttering around me, saying: ‘I’m here.’ A lot of times when I buy her presents, I get her stuff associated with butterflies. Because they just fluttered their way onto the scene. And two of them fluttered away again, but one of them is here.

humansofny,57432,1054,"“All day I am thinking: your son, your son. You need to do something for your son. Yazan is not a normal boy, he’s very disabled. But he’s the most precious thing I’ve got. Before the war he was improving so much. He was going to therapy. He was making good eye contact. He’s very shy, he cannot express his feelings. But I would take him to visit the neighbors and everyone loved him. He’s a lovely boy: he holds my head, he kisses my cheeks. Right before the war we had a surgery on his legs. At that time he was five years old. When the doctors removed his casts I brought him home from the hospital, and I told my daughters and my wife to close their eyes. When they opened their eyes again, Yazan was walking. We’ll never forget this moment; we had so much hope that he’d be a normal boy. But all the clinics have been closed now for two years. He’s had no therapy. Nothing has been done for him, nothing. Now if he walks three steps he falls down. Before the war he’d started to make sentences with a few words: ‘I need bread, I need water.’ Now if he wants something, he’ll just catch me by the arm and show me. And he’s doing this thing now, where he jerks his arms and legs. This is something we’ve never seen before. We thought we would always go forward. We thought that he would be a normal boy. But now I am watching him deteriorate before my eyes. I have a good job; I work on a medical team. But still, I have no power. It takes all my power just to keep him from dying. Last year he got very bad diarrhea. There was no drinkable water. All of the pharmacies were empty. But I heard of a pharmacy six kilometers away with diarrhea medicine. I was so tired. No car, no fuel, no donkey cart. It was like horrible American action movie: there was bombing, shooting from tanks, shooting from helicopter. But I walked six kilometers, and I got him some medicine. And we managed to stop the diarrhea. Anything he needs, I will do. I have two hands. In one of these hands I carry all the problems of my work, all the problems of the war, raising my four daughters with no food, no water, no shelter, no electricity. And in the other hand, I carry Yazan.” 📸 by @nouralsaqa",[],https://www.instagram.com/p/DNjAzg7uL37/,😍😍❤️,"Photo by Humans of New York on August 19, 2025.

humansofny,106627,1561,"“I went to Harvard for my Master’s, but still, I’m always thinking: ‘This can end at any moment. At any moment the leadership is going to decide I wasn’t the right black guy.’ It’s always fight-or-flight. It always feels like the platform I’m standing on is crumbling. It’s just a fact: it’s easier for me to lose everything than someone who doesn’t look like me. When those people slip, there will be people who look like them, who have done what they’re trying to do, who can step in to help them. But there aren’t any doctors in my family; my parents were janitors. They didn’t speak English. We lived in section eight housing. When I was taking all these tests, nobody knew what was going on. I had no understanding of how hard it would be to become a surgeon. And I guess that ignorance helped me in a way; it allowed me to start the journey. But imagery is also so important. When you never see a person that looks like you doing something, it’s hard to believe that you deserve to do it. There weren’t many black people in my medical school. So when I got into Columbia’s surgery program, I was like: ‘Lemme see what white people I’m going to be with.’ I turned on the video where they introduce our co-residents, and the first person I saw was a black Dominican woman. I was like: ‘Yes! I got one.’ The second was white. Then an Asian. But then it was: black, black. That made four of us, in a class of seven. We immediately got together and were like: ‘Guys, we need to be so appreciative of what’s going on here. We need to have a pact that we’re all going to make it.’ That‘s one beautiful part of being a minority: when you find somebody that looks like you, there’s this sense of being on their side already. We get dinners, we get drinks sometimes. We have a group chat—I can’t tell you the name of the group chat, but it keeps us going. Residency is a beast, especially surgical residency. All of us have crash outs, and in those moments it’s so nice to have someone who can bring you back. Someone who looks like you: who you can lean on, and be vulnerable with, and ask for help. Someone you know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, will never think of you as the dumb black doctor.”",[],https://www.instagram.com/p/DMngqexOP3U/,Dope story 🙌🏼,"Photo by Humans of New York on July 27, 2025.",2025-07-27 16:07:14+00:00,108.18799999999999,2193,[]
humansofny,92181,2181,"“I’ve closed my social media. From Gaza it’s all bad news: someone’s dying, someone’s been bombed, someone’s been displaced from their home. Then everywhere else in the world, you see things working so smoothly. Everyone is living their lives. Literally the smallest thing that they do: it makes me jealous. The smallest thing, like eating ice cream. This is my favorite food. And I’ve gone two years without any ice cream. I don’t want to feel envious of anyone, so I’m trying not to see it. I’m still trying to treat myself in whatever small ways I can: like doing my hair, or maybe having henna dye on my hands. After work I will try to sit with my sisters, so we can connect, and say about our dreams. One of my dreams is for us all to live on an empty farm, a quiet place outside all the world. Two of our cousins have already passed away in a bombing. Four of my nieces and nephews were injured. I can’t lose anyone else. I can’t, I won’t be able to take it. My family is everything to me. Right now our home is partially destroyed, but we are still living in it. Because we don’t have anywhere else to go. Every day when I come home from work, my two-year old niece is waiting for me at the front door. Her name is Hanan; it means kindness. And when she hugs me it’s like a battery has charged in my heart. Literally all of her life has been in this war. Whenever she hears the sound of a plane, she covers her ears and says: ‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’ She never goes anywhere. She never meets new people. We are her entire world. We do everything we can to protect her, to give her a childhood. Her birthday was two weeks ago. We had dancing all night. There was bombing all around us, but we just turned up the volume and tried to disconnect from all the noise. Sugar is impossible to get in Gaza now; but we gathered all the sugar we could. Everyone contributed. And with this sugar we made a cake, and cinnamon rolls, and sweet tea with mint. Hanan eats nothing but canned food; no snacks, no treats. So when she saw that cake, she started to scream. All the children started to scream; you can’t imagine their joy. It was maybe my best moment ever, in all of the war.”",[],https://www.instagram.com/p/DNTruwfRgup/,🥀🖤🇵🇸,"Photo by Humans of New York on August 13, 2025.

At 3 AM drones appeared outside the windows of the hospital. Most of my colleagues had already fled. I forgive all of them; few beliefs can override the desire to save one’s own soul. But I could not leave. There were hundreds of patients, and few medical staff remaining. If the last of us left, these patients would have died. The hospital staff assembled in the lobby where we were stripped, handcuffed, blindfolded, and marched into the freezing night. Beneath my blindfold I could see hundreds of fighters with machine guns. I could hear the screams of my colleagues being beaten. My fear was so high I was close to cardiac arrest. Someone speaking weak Arabic put a gun to my head and told me I’d never see my children again. He asked: ‘Where is Hamas? Where are the Hostages?’ I told him: ‘I’m just a nurse; I disagree entirely with October 7th.’ But these guys did not care. They beat us all. The lorries came to transport us to the detention center. At the door of the lorry stood the strongest of their fighters, body-builders. And before entering each detainee received the three hardest punches we will ever receive in our lives. When we arrived we were made to lie on the ground, and they put dogs on us. The dogs had muzzles, but we could not see through our blindfolds. All around me was barking and screaming; I thought my colleagues were being eaten. I was detained for several weeks. The conditions were so bad I prayed to die. One of the prison guards, exactly one, I can accept as my neighbor. The rest had hatred in their eyes. Some spoke English; so I tried to reason with them. I pointed out that half of the detainees had debilitating medical conditions. Some were eighty years old. One man was mentally incapacitated. I asked the guards: ‘How could these people possibly be Hamas?’ But for every claim—they’d have a response. Some reason all of us were guilty. Even when I said: ‘I’m a nurse,’ they replied: ‘Oh, so you treated terrorists.’ To them, every Palestinian deserves to suffer. And nothing you say—nothing— will convince them otherwise.”",[],https://www.instagram.com/p/DNqrwcnu90s/,"Hamas are currently murdering Gazans in broad daylight, refusing to surrender their arms, promising they will wage more war, and have withheld dead hostages that were supposed to be transferred in a deal
